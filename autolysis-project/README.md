# Automated Data Analysis Project 

This project performs automated analysis of datasets using Python, AIProxy GPT models, and visualizations.

##  Features
- Generates correlation heatmaps for datasets
-  Uses GPT-4o-mini model to generate narrative analysis reports
-  Auto-creates multiple charts (distribution plots)
-  Outputs `README.md` and `.png` charts for each dataset
-  Works with:
  - `happiness.csv`
  - `goodreads.csv`
  - `media.csv`

## Project Structure


##  Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - httpx
  - tenacity

##  How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:


2. **Set your AIProxy token** (provided by KaroStartup):
- For Windows (PowerShell):
  ```
  $env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your_actual_token_here"
  ```
- For Linux/Mac:
  ```
  export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your_actual_token_here"
  ```

3. **Run the script**:


=Each run will generate:
- `correlation_matrix.png`
- multiple `*_distribution.png` charts
- dataset-specific `README.md` report

> **Note:** During grading, instructors will use their valid token to generate full AI narrative reports.

## Datasets Used
- `happiness.csv` ➔ World Happiness Report data
- `goodreads.csv` ➔ Goodreads book data
- `media.csv` ➔ Media quality and ratings dataset

## Example Outputs
- Correlation heatmaps (`correlation_matrix.png`)
- Distribution charts (`*_distribution.png`)
- Narrative reports (`README.md` inside each folder)

##  Submission Info
- Submitted as per KaroStartup internship rules
- Repo contains generated reports and visualizations
- Structure matches official examples (like ChinmayNS repo)

This project was completed as part of the Internship
